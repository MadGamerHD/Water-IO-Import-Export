**# üìÑ Water IO**  

**Water IO** is a Blender 4.0 add-on for **importing**, **editing**, **color-coding**, and **exporting** `water.dat` files used in **GTA San Andreas**.

---

## üéØ What Water IO Does

- **Load** (Import) water zones from a `water.dat` file into Blender.  
- **Display** each water zone as its **own separate object** (easy to select and edit).  
- **Mark** objects as **Water Faces** and store per-vertex GTA water parameters (p0‚Äìp3).  
- **Edit** all four parameters for each vertex directly in the **Object Properties** panel.  
- **Automatically color-code** water faces based on depth parameter (p2) using configurable **Shallow Threshold**.  
- **Export** (Save) the selected water zones back into a correctly formatted `water.dat` file.  
- **Automatically adds** the line `processed` at the top of exported files.  
- **Fully supports multi-selection**: you can export multiple water zones at once.

---

## üì• How Import (Load) Works

1. Click **Load water.dat** in the **3D Viewport ‚Üí Sidebar ‚Üí Water IO** tab.  
2. Select your `water.dat` file.  
3. The add-on **reads** each face (triangle or quad) with **7 values** per vertex: X, Y, Z, plus the four GTA water params (p0, p1, p2, p3).  
4. It **creates one Blender object per water face**, grouping them under a collection named **WaterIO** (old data is cleared each import to avoid duplicates).  
5. Each imported object is automatically marked **Is Water Face** and its per-vertex parameters populate the new **water_verts** property group.  

‚úÖ Objects are named `Zone_0`, `Zone_1`, etc., in load order.  

---

## üé® Automatic Color Coding

After import (or whenever parameters change), Water IO assigns a material based on each face's average **depth** (p2):  

- **Shallow Water** (p2 &lt; Shallow Threshold): Light-blue transparent material (`WaterShallow`).  
- **Deep Water** (p2 ‚â• Shallow Threshold): Dark-blue transparent material (`WaterDeep`).  

The **Shallow Threshold** slider in **Scene Properties ‚Üí Water Options** controls the cutoff depth (default: **0.5**).  

Color coding updates automatically on import and when you adjust the threshold or per-vertex parameters.

---

## üíß Water Face Parameters Panel

When you select an object marked **Is Water Face**, a new panel appears in **Object Properties ‚Üí Water Face Parameters**:

- A toggle **Is Water Face** marks or unmarks any mesh object as a water zone.  
- One **boxed section per vertex**, with editable fields for the four parameters **(p0, p1, p2, p3)**.  
- Edits immediately update the internal data and will reflect in color coding on export or manual recolor.

---

## üì§ How Export (Save) Works

1. Select one or more objects marked **Is Water Face** (e.g., `Zone_0`, `Zone_1`, etc.).  
2. Click **Export water.dat** in the **Water IO** tab.  
3. Choose the save location.  
4. The export routine:  
   - Writes **`processed`** as the first line.  
   - Reads the **per-vertex parameters** from each object‚Äôs **water_verts**.  
   - Assembles each face into lines of the form:  
     ```  
     x1 y1 z1 p0 p1 p2 p3   x2 y2 z2 p0 p1 p2 p3   x3 y3 z3 p0 p1 p2 p3   (optional fourth vertex)   1  
     ```  
   - Exports multiple selected zones; touching faces remain separate unless **Prevent Water Merge** is enabled (no merging by default).

---

## üîß Export Options

A new panel in **Scene Properties ‚Üí Water Options** provides:

- **Prevent Water Merge**: When enabled, each zone exports as its own entry even if adjacent‚Äîuseful for preserving distinct regions.
- **Shallow Threshold**: Adjust the depth cutoff for color coding shallow vs. deep water.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Features & Notes

- **Undo/Redo Friendly**: All operations support Blender‚Äôs undo stack.  
- **Triangle & Quad Support**: Works seamlessly with both 3- and 4-vertex faces.  
- **Safe Import**: Lines in `water.dat` with invalid token counts are skipped without crashing.  
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Objects imported with older versions still export correctly.
