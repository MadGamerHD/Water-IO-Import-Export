**# üìÑ Water IO**

**Water IO** is a Blender 4.0 add-on for **importing**, **editing**, and **exporting** `water.dat` files used in **GTA San Andreas**.

---

## üéØ What Water IO Does

- **Load** (Import) water zones from a `water.dat` file into Blender.
- **Display** each water zone as its **own separate object** (easy to select and edit).
- **Mark** objects as **Water Faces** and store per-vertex GTA water parameters (p0‚Äìp3).
- **Edit** all four parameters for each vertex directly in the **Object Properties** panel.
- **Export** (Save) the selected water zones back into a correctly formatted `water.dat` file.
- **Automatically adds** the line `processed` at the top of exported files.
- **Fully supports multi-selection**: you can export multiple water zones at once.

---

## üì• How Import (Load) Works

1. Click **Load water.dat** in the **3D Viewport ‚Üí Sidebar ‚Üí Water IO** tab.
2. Select your `water.dat` file.
3. The add-on **reads** each face (triangle or quad) with **7 values** per vertex: X, Y, Z, plus the four GTA water params (p0, p1, p2, p3).
4. It **creates one Blender object per water face**, grouping them under a collection named **WaterIO**.
5. Each imported object is automatically marked **Is Water Face** and its original per-vertex parameters populate the new **water_verts** property group.

‚úÖ Objects are named `Zone_0`, `Zone_1`, etc., in load order.
‚úÖ Old data in the **WaterIO** collection is cleared on each import to avoid duplicates.

## üíß Water Face Parameters Panel

When you select an object marked **Is Water Face**, a new panel appears in **Object Properties ‚Üí Water Face Parameters**:

- A toggle **Is Water Face** marks or unmarks any mesh object as a water zone.
- The panel shows one **boxed section per vertex**, with editable fields for the four parameters **(p0, p1, p2, p3)**.
- Changing these values updates the data used during export.

---

## üì§ How Export (Save) Works

1. Select one or more objects marked **Is Water Face** (e.g., `Zone_0`, `Zone_1`, etc.).
2. Click **Export water.dat** in the **Water IO** tab.
3. Choose the save location.
4. The export routine:
   - Writes **`processed`** as the first line.
   - Reads the **per-vertex parameters** from each object‚Äôs **water_verts**; falls back to legacy `water_params` if none.
   - Assembles each face into lines of the form:
     ```
     x1 y1 z1 p0 p1 p2 p3   x2 y2 z2 p0 p1 p2 p3   x3 y3 z3 p0 p1 p2 p3   (optional fourth vertex)   1
     ```
   - Optionally **merges** adjacent faces unless the **Prevent Water Merge** option is enabled.

---

## üîß Export Options

A new panel in **Scene Properties ‚Üí Water Export Options** provides:

- **Prevent Water Merge**: Keep water faces separate on export instead of merging them.

Use this toggle to control whether multiple touching water zones export as one continuous region or as distinct entries.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Features & Notes

- **Undo/Redo Friendly**: All operations support Blender‚Äôs undo stack.
- **Triangle & Quad Support**: Works seamlessly with both 3- and 4-vertex faces.
- **Safe Import**: Lines in `water.dat` with invalid token counts are skipped without crashing.
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Objects imported with older versions still export correctly via legacy properties.
